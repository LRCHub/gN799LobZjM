Do you believe in justice
Or so-called co-existence?
What's wrong with politicians?
They only want your best

The economics' growin'
Some tiny holes above
A little radiation
Wake up this planet's worse

You are only watching, you're part of the show
Stand up, and ready to voice and say no

WAR – somebody's always starts again
HATE – we're getting closer to the end

As time goes by
(We never seem to beat the ones
Who say we can't be free)
As times goes by

Do you believe in money?
Do you believe in guns? (Bang, bang)
Do you trust the press, babe?
You'd better trust yourself

You are only watching, you're part of the show
Stand up, and ready to voice and say no

WAR – somebody's always starts again
HATE – we're getting closer to the end

As time goes by
(We never seem to beat the ones
Who say we can't be free)
As times goes by

Missiles are launching, the tanks are rollin'
Guns are blazing, the sky is black

WAR – somebody's always starts again
HATE – seems like this one is any man

As time goes by
(We never seem to beat the ones
Who say we can't be free)
As times goes by
(We're getting closer to the end
Of our ability)
As time goes by
(We never seem to beat the ones
Who say we can't be free)
As times goes by
(We're getting closer to the end
Of our ability)
As time goes by
(Is there a place to run for shelter
In a high tech war)
As time goes by
(Can you believe and trust in God
To help you from above
As time goes by
(Is there a place to run for shelter

As times goes by
