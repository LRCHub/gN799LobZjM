Do you believe in justice
Or so-called co-existence?
What's wrong with politicians?
They give their best for you

The economics' growin'
Some tiny holes above
A little radiation
Wake up this planet fades

You are not watching, you're part of the show
You lost the first prize a long time ago

WAR - somebody always starts again
HATE - we're getting closer to the end

As time goes by
(We never seem to beat the ones
Who say we can't be free)
As time goes by

Do you believe in money?
Do you believe in guns?
Do you trust the press, babe?
You'd better judge yourself

You are not watching, you're part of the show
You lost the first prize a long time ago

WAR - somebody always starts again
HATE - we're getting closer to the end

As time goes by
(We never seem to beat the ones
Who say we can't be free)
As time goes by
(We're getting closer to the end
Of our ability)

The missiles are launching, the tanks are rollin'
The guns are blazing, the sky turns black

WAR - somebody always starts again
HATE - we're getting closer to the end

As time goes by
(We never seem to beat the ones
Who say we can't be free)
As time goes by
(We're getting closer to the end
Of our ability)
As time goes by
(Is there a place to run for shelter
In a high tech war)
As time goes by
(Can you believe and trust in God
To help you from above)
As time goes by
(Is there a place to run for shelter
In a high tech war)
As time goes by
(Can you believe and trust in God
To help you from above)
