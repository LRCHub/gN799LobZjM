I went to Hollywood to buy a new dream
Met this girl one night on the street
She drove me south to a happening bar
We sat and watched old priest from afar

There was the one who talked about Elvis but
Everyone knows that he's dead
There was the girl who kept singing Black Velvet but
I still bought it, I still bought it, I still bought it
Yes, I did

I saw you and you saw me
And we're together
Time goes by so easily
Like sunny weather

You drove me back, said you wanted to leave
Past Santa Monica, face in the breeze
I had this image I was back in that bar
Remember

There was the one who talked about Elvis but
Everyone knows that he's dead
There was the girl who kept singing Black Velvet but
I still bought it, I still bought it, I still bought it
Yes, I did

I saw you and you saw me
And we're together
Time goes by so easily
Like sunny weather

Remember, remember it was Saturday yeah
I remember, it was Saturday, Saturday
I remember

I saw you and you saw me
And we're together
Time goes by so easily
Like sunny weather

Time goes by so easily
Like sunny weather
